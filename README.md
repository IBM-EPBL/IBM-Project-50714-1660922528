Hi everyone! I am Loknath Kumar Mishra. I and my team are working on this amazing projectTh called - "A Gesture-based Tool for Sterile Browsing of Radiology Images". It is
a tool that can be used by surgeons or other medical professors to zoom, blur, resize or flip images without touching the device to do so thereby maintaining the streility
of the environment.

I am doing this project as a part of "Naalaiya Thiran" program by IBM.

The source code is publicly available for everyone. I hope you all like my project. Thank You!
